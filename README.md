# PFC-MINI-PROJECT-NIRANJAN--10895
📊 Marks Grading and Total Calculation System (C Project)
📌 Project Overview

The Marks Grading and Total Calculation System is a console-based application developed using the C programming language. This project allows users to enter marks for multiple subjects, automatically calculates the total marks, determines the percentage, and assigns a grade based on predefined grading criteria.

In addition to calculation, the program also provides motivational feedback to students according to their performance, making the system more interactive and learner-friendly. The project is designed to simulate a real-life educational scenario where evaluation, grading, and result analysis play a crucial role.

The system ensures input validation, meaning it prevents invalid entries such as marks less than 0 or greater than 100. This improves reliability and avoids incorrect calculations. By automating the grading process, the program minimizes human error and saves time, demonstrating how programming can effectively solve real-world academic problems.
